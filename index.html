I worked as a software tester back in the 90s, then moved to a more rural area (Kitsap County). My most recent job was doing the audio recording for a documentary about education around the world (yes, I was the person holding a long pole with a big, fuzzy microphone at the end). While that afforded me the opportunity to see a number of interesting places (Korea, Chile, Sweden and more), I didn't enjoy the actual work as much as I remember enjoying coding. <br><br><span class="first-character">O</span>ver the summer, I dabbled with some online tutorials on my own. I researched a handful of coding boot camps, and &#45; after visiting Galvanize's Pioneer Square location for a free evening class &#45; decided that <em>this</em> was the path I wanted to take.<br><br><span class="first-character">W</span>hen I'm not working, I like to garden (though I have trouble finding the time to do so). I've volunteered at <a href="http://www.heronswoodgarden.org/" target="_blank"><span class="external-links">Heronswood</span></a> quite a bit in the past few years, and hope to somehow still be able to find the time to do so while I'm at Galvanize. I love trying-out IPAs and finding new restaurants with good vegetarian food.<br><br><span class="first-character">I</span> have recently taken-up rock climbing &#40;in the gym &#45; no dangling off of rock faces for me, thank you very much&#41;. I'm really enjoying that and have been to both  <a href="http://www.islandrockgym.com/" target="_blank"><span class="external-links">Island Rock</span></a> on Bainbridge, and <a href="http://seattle.verticalworld.com/" target="_blank"><span class="external-links">Vertical World</span></a> in Ballard.</p>
